<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique
called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes
it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
before November 30.</p>

<p> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it
if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
